You called to say that you miss and love me just so I knew and had the comfort even when I know you do and there is almost reason to doubt you. You have created this world for you and I of absolute love care respect and comfort and security that I never knew I needed or could have. You understand and see that I am an anxious person and who can need reminding you never let me feel like that it‚Äôs too much. You do everything and more to make me feel safe and protected even if I can do it and have been doing it myself. \r\n            Reason #2 to love you- you let me be me and support/understand all of it without making me feel bad or too much of a bad thing. \r\n            I love you as big as the multiverse is. ü§çü§ç"
